This addon is a simple countdown that is used for tracking Elder Trove cooldowns. Hit the "Reset" button when you do your action to get an elder trove. Once the countdown hits 0 and makes the page red, you should be eligible for another trove.

Make sure to specify a custom timer value (in seconds) if you don't have an overcharged or enriched pontifex ring. The default assumes your ring is overcharged and enriched. Check the wiki for specific values: https://runescape.wiki/w/Pontifex_shadow_ring#Upgrades_and_Overcharging
